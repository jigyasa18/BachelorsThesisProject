# BachelorsThesisProject

This is my Bachelor's Thesis Project submitted for fulfillment of the requirements for the Degree of Bachelor of Technology at IIT Guwahati.

Nim is a combinatorial game which can be played by humans easily. My bachelorsâ€™ thesis project is based on determining if a machine learning model can predict if a given config- uration of the game is a winning or a losing configuration. This analysis will also help us conclude whether it is possible for a machine to learn the XOR behaviour. Since XOR is a logic gate, we can also draw conclusions for other gates as well. Any algorithm can be thought of being composed of a circuit of logic gates and logic gates can be simulated by neural net- works. Hence by verifying the claim that a logic gate, XOR in this case, can be modeled by a machine, we would be able to conclude that any algorithm can be learnt by a machine. We aim to verify the claim of Machine Leaning that a machine can learn any algorithm.
